  static const title="In simplified terms, it involves the sending of intimate photos. First and foremost, you should never send intimate photos to anyone, not even to a friend or someone you trust, on any social media platform. Why? Because you never know where the photo might end up. If you've sent a photo, and now someone is forcing you to send more or do things you don't want to do while threatening to send your photos to others, don't give in! Do not respond to the messages and do not let yourself be blackmailed. Do not delete the conversation. Seek professional help. Report it without delay. Social media platforms have reporting buttons that allow you to report inappropriate content.";
